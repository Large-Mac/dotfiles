This is my simple version of DWM.

Patches Applied:

Slstatus (for clickable dwmblocks)
scratchpads (multiple scratchpads)

This build uses pywal, so that is the sole dependency for the build. 

I use devour for the rare times that I need to use the swallow functionality, and I may write my own script using xdo.

This also requires permissions to be set to have dwmblocks and dwm compile during startup.
